Getting pycrypt
===============

Right now, the only way to get pycrypt is to clone it from github `here <https://github.com/PrehistoricTeam/pycrypt/>`_.
You can clone it with::

	git clone https://github.com/PrehistoricTeam/pycrypt.git

Prerequisites
=============

Pycrypt was developed on Python 2.7.5, but should work fine on previous versions.

For graphic capabilities NumPy and pyplot are required. You can get these modules with pip:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	pip install numpy
	pip install pyplot

Optional, but recommended modules are unidecode and ipython console for interactive use:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install unidecode
	pip install ipython

Running tests
=============

Pycrypt has some unit tests, you can run them in shell, while in the root directory of pycrypt, with:

.. code-block:: bash

	python -m unittest discover
