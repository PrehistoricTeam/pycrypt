Solvers
*******

Solvers glue everything we have learned so far together. They will get some keys from a KeyGenerator, apply these keys to the cipher with a Translator and finally score these solutions with a Scorer. They will also take care of printing out progress and optional interactions (during the solving process) from the user.
