What is it for?
===============

Pycrypt was originally intended as a substitution cipher solver. When it did succeed, I wanted to bring to project a little bit further. It is meant to be used in cipher games, which often take place outside and at night. Therefore, pycrypt is (or at least is trying to be) fast to get started in, full of existing useful tools and easily extensible.

What does it do?
================

Pycrypt covers a range of most standard ciphers and usually even solves them. It comes with English and Czech dictionaries to measure cipher's proximity to being solved and right. It has a few solving algorithms and some analytical tools. In addition to some pycrypt's own graphical capability, external libraries fill in.

Who is it for?
==============

Before you start using pycrypt, you should know basic to intermediate python programming. It does **not** come with a user-friendly graphical interface, as it is intended for python script and command line use only.
